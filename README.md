My shit code in Nim for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
The source code for the today puzzle is gitignored to avoid spoilering the solution.
If you use this repo for cheating, I hope the puzzle you receive isn't randomized to the point
you can't solve it with my code.

License is WTFPL.
